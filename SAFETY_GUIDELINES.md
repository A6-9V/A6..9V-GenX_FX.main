# Safety Guidelines and Risk Warning

## ⚠️ High-Risk Trading Engine
The components located in the `experimental/` directory (formerly `core/`, `ai_models/`, and `expert-advisors/`) are for **educational and research purposes only**.

### Risks of Automated Trading:
1. **Market Volatility**: Market conditions can change rapidly, making scripted logic obsolete or dangerous.
2. **Execution Risk**: Bugs in code, network latency, or broker API changes can lead to unintended trades and significant financial loss.
3. **Over-Marketing of "AI"**: The trading signals generated by the "AI" models in this repo are based on standard machine learning algorithms. They are not guaranteed to be profitable and should be treated as experimental.
4. **Risk Management**: While the system includes risk management logic (e.g., ATR-based stop losses), these are not infallible. One bug can lead to an account being blown.

## 🟢 Safe Use Cases (Automation Toolbox)
The scripts in the `automation/` directory (formerly `scripts/`) are generally safe to use for system orchestration, environment setup, and maintenance. However, always review a script before running it, especially if it requires administrative privileges.

### Recommended Best Practices:
- **Never** use real funds with the trading engine. Use Demo accounts only.
- **Run in a Sandbox**: If you must run experimental code, do so in a virtual machine or a dedicated, isolated environment.
- **Review Code**: Always read and understand any script or Expert Advisor before deploying it.
- **Monitor Constantly**: Never "set and forget" an automated trading system.
